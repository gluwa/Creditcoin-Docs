# Version 2.3 - 2023-08-31

Version 2.3 of Creditcoin introduces some of our largest updates so far. Chief among these is the change from a SHA3-based Proof-of-Work consensus to a more accessible and environmentally friendly Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) system. The introduction of NPoS means community members will be able to participate in strengthening the network and receiving rewards without having to run and maintain their own Validator nodes. Validators additionally benefit by no longer need to invest in high-powered computers or the energy needed to run them. These changes help ensure the longevity and scalability of the Creditcoin blockchain for years to come.

We've also introduced several completely new components to the Creditcoin ecosystem. The [Creditcoin Staking Dashboard](https://staking.creditcoin.org) provides a clean interface for users to monitor and manage their stake and their rewards. The [Creditcoin CLI ](https://github.com/gluwa/creditcoin/tree/dev/scripts/cc-cli)offers the more technically minded a simple way to perform common tasks when managing their Validator nodes and can be integrated more easily to create custom scripts and actions.

Below is a list of the most notable changes and additions.
