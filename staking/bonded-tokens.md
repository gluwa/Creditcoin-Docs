# Bonded Tokens

When staking, CTC must be bonded in a Stash account. This is a process by which tokens are "frozen" in exchange for some other benefit. In the Creditcoin network, users can bond their tokens in exchange for the right to participate in consensus and receive rewards.

To be able to transfer the staked tokens, these tokens must go through an unbonding period in which they may not be used to nominate validators and do not contribute to earning any rewards. Unbonding in Creditcoin takes 7 days. This is a security measure designed to align security and economic incentives for both validators and nominators, ensuring that those participating in consensus have “skin in the game” as they cannot exit their positions right away.
