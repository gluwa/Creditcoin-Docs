# Testnet

Creditcoin Testnet usually runs newer versions of the Creditcoin runtime which are under active development and testing. It is the recommended network to try out new features.

## Proof-of-Stake Testnet

Currently, Creditcoin's Testnet is running a new consensus mechanism based on Nominated Proof-of-Stake. Users are encouraged to try out the new features and collaborate on testing the new Validator and Nominator roles. Find out more about Proof-of-Stake in the [Staking](../staking/) section.

## Connecting to Testnet
