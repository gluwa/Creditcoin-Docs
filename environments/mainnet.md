# Mainnet

Mainnet is the main network where CTC has real-world economic value. Most Creditcoin software, including the Creditcoin node, will connect to mainnet by default unless the user specifies another network.

It is not recommended to test new features on mainnet. It is more appropiate to test using testnet o devnet.

Mainnet bootnodes:

* `/dns4/bootnode.creditcoin.network/tcp/30333/p2p/12D3KooWAEgDL126EUFxFfdQKiUhmx3BJPdszQHu9PsYsLCuavhb`
* `/dns4/bootnode2.creditcoin.network/tcp/30333/p2p/12D3KooWSQye3uN3bZQRRC4oZbpiAZXkP2o5UZh6S8pqyh24bF3k`
