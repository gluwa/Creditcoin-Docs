Once installed, click on the Polkadot-JS extension icon to open up the account menu. Create one by selecting the plus sign (+) and following the instructions. Be sure to write down your recovery seed; it is the only way to recover access to your account.

## **Connect to your node using Polkadot-JS**

Polkadot-JS APPS is a web UI for interacting with Substrate based nodes like Creditcoin. It allows validators to manage their accounts and set up their nodes.

Open the Polkadot-JS APPS site using either the [hosted](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.mainnet.creditcoin.network%2Fws#/explorer) or [IPFS](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipns/dotapps.io/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.mainnet.creditcoin.network%2Fws#/) version. In the upper-left corner, click on the network ID to open the menu and select Local Node from the Development tab. Use the default URL or enter your own. Click on Switch to apply connect to your node.
